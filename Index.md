# Desk In The Cloud

## Intro
Desk in the .Cloud is my ocasional musings about Microsoft, Endpoints, ConfigMgr, Intune, Windows and the challenges of moving to the “work from anywhere” world.

Useful bits I have come across, and links to those awesome people in our community that share the knowledge.

### Give praise where its due.

I work in IT, most of what I come across has been written about or encountered before by someone somewhere. All content will include links to where the information came from. Anytime there is content that was blogged earlier then let me know and I can call out the original hero or heroines.

Those that know me know my writing will be sporadic and often not very eloquent.

### Give back to the community

We find what works, build on scripting skills and knowledge of others. Remember to feedback and help others.

A little about me? 25+ years working deploying, supporting and designing Microsoft solutions to varying degrees of success. I’ve been fortunate to work with some awesome companies and some very clever people in those companies.

I’m still learning, and intend to as long as I can use a keyboard. Learning from mistakes helps us develop, sharing those mistakes helps stop them happening again.
